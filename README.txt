pong game implementation for my CS course at Dulwich College, London

it's shitty, but the idea was right - to develop a cool computational
geometry library. I developed something, but lost motivation to make it
cool and shiny, with friction, points, etc.

also the code is pretty clean and i've implemeneted special methods in
my objects so that the objects are intuitive to use, e.g. checking collision
by `if obj1 & obj2 is not None` or `rect1 in circ2`
